                    <p>Star Citizen is a game that has been in development by Cloud Imperium Games since the pre-production back in 2010.</p>
                    <p>Every year Cloud Imperium Games does an event called Citizen Con and adds 930 years onto whatever our current year is, so this years Citizen Con will be 2953. Within Citizen Con they talk about what features they are working on show some of them off, they will o over what has been successfully achieved this year and what their next goal is and how they plan to reach it. They will thank all the people for support and just be a friendly group of developers, they will also answer many question that people have had (if possible).</p>
                    <p>Cloud Imperium has been getting massive crowdfunding over the years, e.g. in the first year they were able to get $6.2 million, not long after reaching $15 million, $40 milion and last year Septmeber 2022 they were able to reach a wopping $500 million through just crowdfunding over the years (this doesn't include private funding).</p>
                    <p>As of 2020-12, CIG has a total of 695 staff, of which 512 are developers, making what they do quite an impresive task with the ammount of work each person has to do to stick to the deadline (or as close as physically possible).</p>

                    <p>First of all to install the game, you will have to go to the Cloud Imperium Games specific webpage online called 'Robert Space Industries', this page will allow you to create an account for the game, and then you can browse what ship you want to buy so that you can uses it in-game (note that most ships are able to be bought inside of the game using the currency called aUEC)</p>
                    <p>Gameplay wise you are thrown into a solar system called Stanton, and within this system there are many different planets, moons, and asteroid belts. The graphics in the game are outstanding, and also implements multiple different physics based on the real world, since it is still in development there are many issues that appear e.g. many years ago there was a bug where you could kill yourself by just running down a stair case after they recoded a few physics engine designs, but was quickly pathced showing just how much effort Cloud Imperium puts into this, especially since the development team consists of around 500 people after over 10 years of development.</p>
