                        <p>Almost all reviews mention that the games been in development for a longtime, which is a key feature when looking at this game, as the full release date isn't set in stone, and you may need to wait a lot longer than you think before this game is anywhere near finished.</p>
                        <p>Indie Games review is great, as it mentions how the game is full of features, and stuff to do. It also goes so far as to mention many flaws as well such as how its an "Incredibly Ambitiuos" game, and how its also full of a wide variety of bugs as its oly in Alpha, and finally its also quite an expensive game to get into.</p>
                        <p>On metacritic there are many mixed views, from the game looks incredible and plays incredible, to even some people claiming that it's better off to go for another game like starfield, as currently the funding is being focused on Squadron 42 on Star Citizen (a single player campaign) and therefore it will be much longer untill more new content comes out into the multiplayer version.</p>
