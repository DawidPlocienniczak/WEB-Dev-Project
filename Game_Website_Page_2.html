                        <header>What can you do so far?</header>
                        <p>Currently in the game there are three game modes, these are 'Arena Commander', 'Universe', and 'Star Marine', Universe is the primary game mode as it lets you explore a system called Stanton, within this system you are able to do Mining which can be done with vehicles in space or on a planet (some can be only done manually in small caves), Hunting bounties, completing general missions such as cargo transport, or even becoming a criminal yourself (which will put a bounty on your head and there is a prisno system in the game), be aware that there is no wildlife in the game yet so many of the planets can feel a bit empty sometimes, other than the beautiful scenery and landscape that the player can see, even when in outter space (note that all types of missions that you complete successfully will increase your charachter reputation allow you to gain access to new and more dangerous missions. </p>
                        <p>Arena Commander is a rather small gamemode which allows the user to do races in and out of orbit, same goes for the dogfighting with space craft, you can get it to put you up against hordes of enemys, or compete against other players taking the players combat skills to its breaking point.</p>
                        <p>Finally we have Star Marine which is the least played and smallest of the three game modes, as its essentially and fps shooter game mode where equal numbered teams are up against each other, and need to contest for zones, they would do this by hacking into the zone computer and then defend it, there is also a free-for-all mode, but this game mode is just like any other shooter, other than it can be a mixed map of zero gravity and on the ground combat (including close quarter combat / melee combat).</p>

                        <header>What features are to be expected?</header>
                        <p>Star citizens Alpha patch 4.0 will be the next major update and game changer as it will include an entirely new system for players to traverse, it will also include server meshing and new jump points for players to go between the Stanton system and (new) Star System Pyro which is going to be larger in size and require ship to ship refueling for many ofthe smaller vessels due to the long sdistances that you will have to travel. It will also be a less lawful system compared to Stanton as there is less infrastructure built up in it. </p>
